# Educational-App

## Overview

This app was developed as an aid for helping young children learn how to read. It is meant to be both entertaining and educational. 
*Ideally, parents will be using the app with their children to help facilitate the learning process. 
*With the flash cards, children can practice reading a word that populates on the card. If they are having a hard time, we have a text-to-speech function built in to help them pronounce the word before moving on to the next card. 
*We have also included a wild card feature, where children can type in words they know, such as their own name, and have the app speak it back to them.
*We have also built in a memory game to help them with reading simple words. 
*Additionally, a drawing feature can provide an artistic outlet for kids if they need a break from reading.
